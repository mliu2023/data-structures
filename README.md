# Data-structures
This repository contains code written in my data structures class. We covered data structures such as vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, (self-balancing) binary trees, and heaps. In addition, we built a simple functional language, Clac. We were introduced to unit tests using JUnit.
